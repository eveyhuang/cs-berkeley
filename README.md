Projects I did for Berkeley CS classes


1. Map: http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp15/proj/maps/
To create a data visualization of restaurants ratings using Yelp academic dataset. 
"In this visualization, Berkeley is segmented into regions, where each region is shaded by the predicted rating of the closest restaurant (yellow is 5 stars, blue is 1 star). "
