Projects I did for Berkeley CS classes


1. Map:  
Using Python, I created a data visualization of restaurants ratings using Yelp academic dataset. 
"In this visualization, Berkeley is segmented into regions, where each region is shaded by the predicted rating of the closest restaurant (yellow is 5 stars, blue is 1 star). "

2. Scheme:  
Using Python, I developed an interpreter for a subset of the Scheme language.

3. Canfield Solitaire:  
Using Java and Model–view–controller design pattern, I re-created the card game Canfield
Solitaire.

4. SQL Database System: 
Using Java, I implemented a relational database management system that uses commands
similar to those of SQL to store and access data.
